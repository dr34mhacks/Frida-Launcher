## Requirements

- **Android Version:** 7.0 Nougat (API 24) or higher
- **USB Debugging:** Enabled
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading Frida binaries
- **Root Access:** Mandatory
- **Superuser Manager App:** Installed (e.g., Magisk, Built from Source
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/thecybersandeep/Frida-Launcher
cd Frida-Launcher

# Build APK
./gradlew clean assembleDebug

# Or install directly
./gradlew installDebug
```

> üí° **Pro Tip:** Open in Android Studio for a smoother build experience.

## Usage

1. Launch **Frida Launcher**.
2. Grant **Storage** and **Root (su)** permissions via your Superuser Manager app.
3. Tap **Refresh** to check Frida server status.
4. Select a Frida version and tap **Install**.
5. Hit **Start** to run the server.
6. Use **Stop** or **Uninstall** as needed.
7. Monitor real-time logs in the **Logs Panel**.

## How It Works

Frida Launcher streamlines Frida server management with smart automation. Here's the magic behind each action:

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Refresh** | Scans device architecture (e.g., `arm64`), checks Frida installation/running status, and updates the UI. |
| **Install** | Downloads the correct Frida binary, places it in the right directory, and sets executable permissions (`chmod +x`). |
| **Start** | Runs the Frida server in the background using root (`su`). Logs confirm successful startup. |
| **Stop** | Kills the running Frida server process with root commands. |
| **Uninstall** | Removes the Frida server binary from the device. |
| **Logs Panel** | Streams live server logs with options to copy or clear. |
| **Custom Flags** | Allows passing custom arguments (e.g., `-D`, `-n`) to the Frida server. |
| **Help Dialogs** |  Flags info |

### Smart UI Logic
- Buttons (Start, Stop, Uninstall) activate only when relevant.
- **Install** unlocks after selecting a version.
- **Start** enables post-installation.
- **Stop** activates only when the server is running.
- The UI **auto-refreshes** after actions like Stop or Uninstall to keep status accurate.

All actions are designed to prevent errors and ensure seamless server management.
